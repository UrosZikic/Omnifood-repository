This is my fully optimized and natively built website

It is based on pure HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
This is the website I built after finishing the course on UDEMY
This website is supposed to simulate a real website which sells AI generated recepies which are based on a clean, healthy vegan/vegitarian food. 
It includes all the important sections a website should have, starting with the header, the main section which holds all the important body contents and the footer.

JavaSCript code was implemented mostly to make my website optimized for Safari users so the scroll animation would work, some if it is a copied code I found online.

Feel free to take a sneak peek at my code, since it's built with plain css and html, it doesn't require any framework knowledge to be understandable.
